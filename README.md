# Develop in Swift Data Collections

## Unit 1 Tables and Persistence

- In this unit, you'll learn three important sets of techniques in app development, which—taken together—will enable you to build more much complex apps.
  - First, you'll learn how to use tables to display lists of information, and to use the master-detail design pattern to allow users to interact with the information.
  - Second, you'll learn how to organize the files, structures, and classes in your apps, making it easier for you (or other developers) to work with them in the future.
  - Third, you'll learn about an approach for saving data to the device, so that any information the user enters or changes in your app will still be there the next time they open the app.
  - By the end of this unit, you'll be comfortable building many useful apps that display all kinds of information and that allow users to enter, edit, and save in-app information.

### Lesson 1.1 Protocols

- A protocol is a set of rules or procedures that define how things are done. Computers communicate with each other using protocols like HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol) and TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol).
  - HTTP is a standard that defines how website data is communicated between two computers.
  - TCP/IP is a communications standard that defines how computers find and send data to each other.
- In programming, a protocol defines the properties or methods that an object must have to complete a task. For example, the `Equatable` protocol says that a type must define a `==` method to check whether two instances are equal to each other.
- In this lesson, you'll learn what protocols are, when to use them, and how to write your own. You'll also learn about delegation, a pattern for enabling objects to communicate with each other.
- A protocol defines a blueprint of methods, properties, and other requirements that suit a particular task or piece of functionality. The protocol can then be adopted by another type, which provides the actual implementation for those requirements. Any type that satisfies the requirements of a protocol conforms to that protocol.
- The Swift standard library defines many protocols that you'll use when building apps. In the following sections, you'll look at four of them:
  - `CustomStringConvertible`, which allows you to control how your custom objects are printed to the console;
  - `Equatable`, which allows you to define how instances of the same type are equal to each other;
  - `Comparable`, which allows you to define how instances of the same type are sorted; and
  - `Codable`, which allows you to encode your type's properties as key/value pairs that can then be saved between app launches.
- When you adopt a protocol in Swift, you're promising to implement all the methods required by that protocol. The compiler will check that everything's in order and won't build your program if anything is missing.

#### Printing Information with `CustomStringConvertible`

- You can begin to understand the role of a protocol by considering how objects are printed to the console using the `print()` function. As you've learned, running the print() function on a variable will write the textual representation of the object to the console. You can print String values, Int values, and Bool values with predictable results.
- But what if you define a Shoe class?

  - ```swift
      class Shoe {
        let color: String
        let size: Int
        let hasLaces: Bool
       
        init(color: String, size: Int, hasLaces: Bool) {
          self.color = color
          self.size = size
          self.hasLaces = hasLaces
        }
      }
       
      let myShoe = Shoe(color: "Black", size: 12, hasLaces: true)
      let yourShoe = Shoe(color: "Red", size: 8, hasLaces: false)
      print(myShoe)
      print(yourShoe)
      Console Output:
      Shoe
      Shoe
    ```

- (Your print statement is likely prefixed by something like \_lldb_expr_1, which you can ignore.)
- As you can see, this print statement isn't at all helpful. Swift defines a protocol called CustomStringConvertible to address this kind of situation.
- CustomStringConvertible has one required computed property, description, which returns a String representation of the instance. If you adopt the protocol, you control exactly how your custom types are represented as printable String values.

  - First, adopt the protocol by adding a colon and the name of the protocol you want to adopt:

    - ```swift
        class Shoe: CustomStringConvertible {
          let color: String
          let size: Int
          let hasLaces: Bool
        }
      ```

  - Second, conform to the protocol by adding the required functions or variables. In this example, you'll add the description computed property. If you don't complete this step, the compiler will display an error that says you're not conforming to the protocol.
  - In the Strings lesson, you learned how to use string interpolation to interweave constants or variables into a String value. The description property in the following code uses string interpolation to create a String that includes each property of the Shoe instance.

    - ```swift
        class Shoe: CustomStringConvertible {
            let color: String
            let size: Int
            let hasLaces: Bool
         
            init(color: String, size: Int, hasLaces: Bool) {
                self.color = color
                self.size = size
                self.hasLaces = hasLaces
            }
         
            var description: String {
                return "Shoe(color: \(color), size: \(size), hasLaces: \(hasLaces))"
            }
        }
        let myShoe = Shoe(color: "Black", size: 12, hasLaces: true)
        let yourShoe = Shoe(color: "Red", size: 8, hasLaces: false)
        print(myShoe)
        print(yourShoe)

        Console Output:
        Shoe(color: Black, size: 12, hasLaces: true)
        Shoe(color: Red, size: 8, hasLaces: false)
      ```

  - Note that this code prints out what looks like an initializer for each object. That's a common practice, because it enables you to see each property on the object in a familiar, concise format. However, you can print anything you want:

    - ```swift
        var description: String {
            let doesOrDoesNot = hasLaces ? "does" : "does not"
            return "This shoe is \(color), size \(size), and \(doesOrDoesNot) have laces."
        }
         
        let myShoe = Shoe(color: "Black", size: 12, hasLaces: true)
        let yourShoe = Shoe(color: "Red", size: 8, hasLaces: false)
        print(myShoe)
        print(yourShoe)

        Console Output:
        This shoe is Black, size 12, and does have laces.
        This shoe is Red, size 8, and does not have laces.
      ```
